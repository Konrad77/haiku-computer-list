HP T5720
Rating: Excellent (everything works... except maybe the camera or fingerprint reader) 
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1
CPU: Transmeta Efficieon
Memory: 1GB
Additional notes (multi-line): 
  it can boot Haiku from USB and do simple tasks,
  web browsing is possible but is pushing it, Netsurf would be fine for this PC.
  If you use a CF to IDE adapter you can upgrade the storage of this PC easily or put an IDE HDD/SSD in it.
  I would lean toward an HDD as it will survive disk swapping better.
  It is very low powerâ€¦ I intend to use it as an always on IRC box.
