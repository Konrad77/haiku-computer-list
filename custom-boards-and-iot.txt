Asrock Fata1ity gaming/ITX board
Rating: Good (nearly everything works; e.g. the display, audio, ports, peripherals work, but no Wifi)
Version: Haiku R1 Beta 1
CPU: Ryzen 1700x
GPU: Vega FE
Memory: 16GB ram
Additional notes: only boots with 4GB limit enabled in bootloader + failsafe video, its rediculously fast though for a Haiku box. Built in Wifi works as it’s a compatible intel chipset, ethernet works.
