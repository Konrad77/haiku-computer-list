Additional notes: Go into BIOS settings and look for ‘USB 3.0 Configuration in Pre-OS’ and change the factory setting of ‘Enabled’ to ‘Auto’.

Additional notes (multi-line):

- Requires "enable serial debug output" (weird timing issue) and "failsafe graphics mode" enabled to boot.
- You need to increase font sizes to be able to see anything on the screen.
